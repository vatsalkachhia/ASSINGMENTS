# Approaches to Continuously Improve Detection Accuracy Using Feedback from Post-Paint Inspections

### 1. **Active Learning with Human-in-the-Loop**

**Why this approach?**
The feedback data provides direct corrections from human inspectors, creating high-quality labeled examples. Active learning focuses model improvement on the most uncertain or error-prone cases, maximizing learning efficiency from limited feedback.

**Pros**

* **Targeted Improvement**: Focuses on cases where the model is most uncertain or makes mistakes
* **Data Efficiency**: Requires fewer labeled examples to achieve significant improvements
* **Continuous Adaptation**: Can adapt to new defect patterns and environmental conditions
* **Quality Assurance**: Human feedback ensures high-quality ground truth labels
* **Cost Effective**: Reduces annotation burden by selecting most informative samples

**Cons**

* **Human Dependency**: Requires consistent human expert availability for feedback
* **Potential Bias**: Human inspectors may introduce subjective biases
* **Scalability Issues**: May not scale well with very high throughput systems
* **Feedback Delay**: Improvement depends on timely human feedback collection

### 2. **Online Learning with Concept Drift Detection**

**Why this approach?**
Paint defect patterns can change over time due to equipment wear, environmental shifts, or process modifications. Online learning continuously updates the model as new feedback arrives, while concept drift detection identifies when significant changes occur.

**Pros**

* **Real-time Adaptation**: Model updates immediately as new feedback becomes available
* **Handles Process Changes**: Automatically adapts to equipment wear, seasonal variations, etc.
* **No Retraining Downtime**: Updates happen incrementally without stopping the system
* **Drift Detection**: Identifies when significant process changes occur requiring attention
* **Memory Efficient**: Doesn't require storing all historical data

**Cons**

* **Catastrophic Forgetting**: May lose knowledge of older patterns when adapting to new ones
* **Stability Issues**: Frequent updates might make predictions less stable
* **Complex Implementation**: Requires sophisticated drift detection and model update mechanisms
* **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Performance heavily depends on learning rate and update frequency

### 3. **Multi-Task Learning with Auxiliary Feedback Tasks**

**Why this approach?**
The feedback data includes both defect type and root cause corrections. Multi-task learning can simultaneously improve both tasks while learning shared representations, leading to better overall performance.

**Pros**

* **Shared Learning**: Common features between defect detection and root cause analysis improve both tasks
* **Data Efficiency**: Leverages feedback for multiple related tasks simultaneously
* **Regularization Effect**: Prevents overfitting and improves generalization
* **Holistic Understanding**: Model develops deeper understanding of defect-environment relationships
* **Consistent Predictions**: Ensures alignment between defect type and root cause predictions

**Cons**

* **Task Interference**: Improving one task can hurt performance on another
* **Complex Architecture**: Requires careful design of shared and task-specific components
* **Balancing Challenges**: Need to balance learning across different tasks with different difficulty levels
* **Debugging Complexity**: Harder to isolate issues when multiple tasks are involved

# Approaches to Get Correlations Between Environmental Conditions and Defect Likelihood

### 1. **Tree-Based Ensembles (XGBoost / LightGBM / CatBoost) with SHAP / ALE**

**Why this approach?**
Strong predictive performance on nonlinear, interacting sensor features (including lags). SHAP/ALE explains which environmental factors and ranges most increase defect likelihood.

**Pros**

* Captures complex interactions and threshold effects without heavy manual feature engineering
* Handles missing values, mixed scales, and imbalanced classes (class weights)
* Fast inference for real-time scoring; SHAP/ALE provide ranked drivers and effect curves

**Cons**

* Less intrinsically interpretable than parametric models; relies on post-hoc explanations
* Requires temporally aware validation to avoid leakage; probability calibration often needed
* Hyperparameter tuning and feature lagging/windowing still matter; risk of spurious correlations if confounders unaccounted

---

### 2. **Generalized Additive Models (GAM) with Splines**

**Why this approach?**
Learn smooth, interpretable nonlinear relationships between each environmental variable (and its lags) and defect probability, ideal for explaining correlations to process engineers.

**Pros**

* Transparent per-variable effect curves with uncertainty; easy to impose monotonicity or shape constraints
* Good bias-variance tradeoff; robust to moderate data sizes; straightforward to calibrate probabilities
* Supports multi-class (per defect type) or one-vs-rest setups

**Cons**

* Requires thoughtful lag/interaction engineering; limited ability to capture high-order interactions unless added
* Can become heavy with many sensors and lags (spline basis growth)
* May underperform vs ensembles in highly complex regimes

---

### 3. **Bayesian Hierarchical Models (Multilevel GLM/GAM)**

**Why this approach?**
Correlations vary by booth, color, robot, shift, and season. Hierarchical modeling pools information across groups while allowing group-specific effects and providing principled uncertainty.

**Pros**

* Partial pooling stabilizes estimates for sparse segments (rare colors/defects/shifts)
* Uncertainty-aware decisions (credible intervals for effects) and ability to encode domain priors
* Extensible to time-varying effects and missing-data handling within the model

**Cons**

* Higher modeling and computational complexity; slower training/inference
* Requires careful prior specification and diagnostics; expertise needed
* Real-time deployment may need distilled/simplified versions for latency

### Other Approaches

* Exploratory correlation and lag analysis (Pearson/Spearman, MI, cross-correlation)
* Regularized GLM (logistic/Poisson) with engineered lags/interactions
* Temporal deep learning (TCN, LSTM/GRU, Transformers)
* Probabilistic graphical models / Bayesian networks
* Causal inference (double ML, causal forests, IV, DoWhy)
* Multi-task learning across defect types
* Unsupervised/semi-supervised anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, autoencoders)
* Change-point/drift detection with regime-specific models
* State-space sensor fusion (Kalman/particle filters) and latent factors
* Rule-based learning (decision lists, Bayesian Rule Lists, monotonic GBMs)
* Event-rate models (Poisson/Negative Binomial, Hawkes) at batch/shift level
* Online learning and contextual bandits for action policies
